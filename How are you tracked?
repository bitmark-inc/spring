# How are you tracked?

Facebook constantly tracks you. It doesn’t matter if you are logged in to the Facebook site or not. Here are of the ways they collect your data: 

1. **“Like” and “Share” buttons**
The Facebook “Like” and “Share” buttons, found on almost every website, funnel data back into the Facebook advertising algorithm. Everything people do, either on Facebook directly or on sites that have these buttons, reveal information about them to Facebook. They can even track you when you’re logged out, because their extensive surveillance network on sites that link to them.

2. **Apps you install**
Facebook gets third-party apps to give them access to your data. Facebook can also give those apps access to the data of your friends, even if those friends haven't downloaded the app or consented in any way. These connected apps provide information about your activities off Facebook—including information about your device, websites you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use their services.

3. **Facial recognition** 
Facial recognition is a handy feature you can use when you want to call up all the pictures you and your friends, but it also means Facebook can now recognize you in photos without you actually having to go to the trouble of tagging yourself.

4. **Online “tests”**
Facebook buys data from brokers via partnerships without any consent. Results of online tests you have taken for fun, are often run by data surveillance companies to build psychometric profiles (Ex: Cambridge Analytica). This information is then shared with Facebook.

5. **Device location and connectivity information**
Even without access to your accurate location data from the smartphone, Facebook uses information from your browsing habits, including IP address, Wi-Fi network, and Bluetooth to pinpoint your whereabouts and place relevant ads inside its apps. Facebook uses city and zip level location which they collect from IP addresses and other information such as check-ins and current city from user profile.
