You also agree to our [privacy policy](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/spring/blob/master/privacy-policy.md) and the terms for the data analysis project(s) in which you participate, which we will present to you at the time.

You shall not modify or remove any copyright or other notices contained in or displayed on any the Software. We reserve all rights not specifically granted above, subject to any separate open source software licenses in the Software or components thereof. The Software contains a “Legal Notices” section which lists any open source software licenses for its components, and you may visit [https://github.com/bitmark-inc/spring](https://github.com/bitmark-inc/spring) for a copy of the source code which we own and have made available  under an open source license.

You may choose to submit comments, information or feedback to us regarding the Software or services to us orally or in writing, and if you do so, you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable right to use the same in any manner for any purpose without compensation to you.

THE SOFTWARE IS MADE AVAILABLE “AS IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”  WE DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE IS OR WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE.  IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, SAVINGS OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), IN EACH CASE HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  

OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  

YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW IMPLIED WARRANTIES TO BE EXCLUDED OR MODIFIED OR LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED, SO NOT ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY APPLY TO YOU, AND THESE DISCLAIMERS AND WARRANTIES ARE MADE ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 

The disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between you and us, and you acknowledge and agree that we would not provide the Software to you without these limitations.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Our failure to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
