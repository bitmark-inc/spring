# Spring FAQ

_Last updated: 16-JAN 2020_


# What is Spring?

Spring is a mobile app (iPhone, Android) to free you from Facebook's walled garden by putting you in control of your Facebook data:

*   Back up your Facebook data automatigically
*   Learn about how you use Facebook,
*   Gain insights about what Facebook knows about you, and
*   Understand how Facebook is able to monetize you through its partners.

Your data and insights are always private, under your control.

**Using Spring does not require you to terminate your Facebook account.**


# Who are the people behind Spring?

[Bitmark builds Spring](https://bitmark.com); we have been working to restore trust in data since 2014.

Our team is led by [Sean Moss-Pultz](https://moss-pultz.com/), who started the world's first open-source mobile phone, Openmoko, with the mission to simply free your phone. We are a diverse group dispersed across three continents.

Our mission with Spring: to free you from Facebook so you can do something better with your data beyond being sold to the highest bidder.

You can see all of us working on Spring through [Discord](https://discord.gg/mxy7QbM), and even chat with us directly. To learn more about our team, see our website [and learn about our backgrounds.](https://bitmark.com/company/)


# How can I trust you?

When it comes to your personal data, trust must be earned. Unfortunately, there is no simple way to guarantee you can trust us (or anybody else for that matter) to secure your personal data.

What we can do is be transparent. That's why everyone can see our work in progress on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mxy7QbM) and our documents on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@bitmarkinc/spring). Spring is also open-source, meaning that anyone can independently verify how we programmed it. Spring uses the same underlying Bitmark technology that our partners including UC Berkeley and Pfizer trust to manage rights to their personal health data while preserving privacy.

Bitmark does not and will never claim rights to your data for any purpose including selling it.

You may review our [Privacy Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NDi5jEwTTzjT3vq_fPqOSMPVFIBekMFT-N1u5Olmj8w/edit?usp=sharing) and [EULA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NDi5jEwTTzjT3vq_fPqOSMPVFIBekMFT-N1u5Olmj8w/edit?usp=sharing) - if anything is not clear, please ask us about it.


# How do you make money?

**You are our customer and never the product.**

Spring is currently in Alpha and will be entirely free until we graduate into a subscription model. By paying for Spring once we are out of Beta, you support our mission.

*   You are always in control of your data
*   You can stop using the app at any time.
*   You can download all of your data at any time.

Bitmark does not and will never claim rights to your data for any purpose including selling it.

# How does Spring protect my data?

Spring stores all personal data in encrypted cloud storage. No login and password exists. You sign in and control your data using a private key stored in your phone’s secure keychain.

Spring uses Bitmark, the end-to-end protocol for securing data provenance. We use this protocol to record the registration of the rights to your data on the blockchain. Your data itself is not on the blockchain. Only the hash of your data is recorded as your ownership claim. This method means that, no single individual, corporation, or government can deny your claim to your data. In the future, the Bitmark protocol will let you control access to your data without requiring any 3rd party. It’s an entirely new architecture for securing personal information. 

For the technically inclined, the Bitmark protocol uses its own, independent public blockchain, optimized for storing property titles, or _bitmark certificates_, and does not have its own internal currency (transaction fees are in bitcoin). Consensus is secured using argon2 hashing (proof-of-work). Chain of ownership is immutable and digitally signed. Plans are in place for long-term, post-quantum signatures (SPHINCS-256). Ready, for when [quantum computers](http://quantum.country/qcvc) become a thing. 

To learn more, [here is a technical overview](https://bitmark.com/papers/) of the protocol.


# Can I share my data?

Currently, no. But in the future, we'll show you how you can use your data, give you the tools to work with it, and combine it with other personal data, not just to learn about yourself, but to fuel new products and research -- all without you ever losing control.

How is that possible? Instead of sharing a copy of your data, Spring will provide you with your own API for other apps and services to bring their algorithms to your data. It’s the technological equivalent of bringing a historian to the archives, rather than handing a copy of the archives to the historian.

In this sense, Spring is like a bootloader that can, over time, lead to alternative social networks and other exciting services where people are always in control of their data. That’s the future we want.

# Will Spring get ALL my Facebook data?

Spring automatically retrieves your Facebook information archive. This will include your entire timeline, all your posts, likes, comments, etc. [Facebook has full detail](https://www.facebook.com/help/930396167085762) of the data available.

Spring also gets other bits of information to help you understand how Facebook matches your digital profile for advertising.

We currently provide insights into:

*   How you use Facebook
*   The amount of revenue Facebook made from you
*   Whether you were part of [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/04/cambridge-analytica-data-leak-global-election-manipulation)’s political manipulations
*   The sentiment analysis of your posts
*   Ad interests tracked by Facebook
*   Advertisers that collected data about you
*   Locations tracked by Facebook
*   Ad categories
*   How to strengthen your privacy
*   How Facebook tracks you 

We plan to add more insights over time, based on what people want to see. ([Learn more about the features](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s3UbqVvgCcf4ujCRNbH6aprGz1Lw6ye2cyJWgSZ30JY/edit?folder=0AGnlT5zxeuuXUk9PVA#heading=h.778a9q426s02) we are considering.

Facebook is selective with what they consider your data. For example, the following personal data is not included:

*   information they collect about your browsing history
*   information they collect about the apps you visit and your activity within those apps
*   information shared with other Facebook-owned platforms, eg: Instagram, WhatsApp
*   websites you visited and were tracked by "Like" buttons
*   information you share via share buttons on external websites.
*   advertisers that uploaded your contact information to Facebook more than two months earlier
*   ads that you interacted with more than two months prior

Over time, we hope to find new methods of helping you get more of your data from Facebook. 


# How do I stop using Spring?

You are free to export all your data and delete your account at any time within the app. 


# How can I help?

First, thank you for using Spring! By paying for Spring once we are out of Beta, you support our mission and send a strong signal that people care about their #digital rights.

Beyond that, help us by:

1. Letting us know how it works for you. How do we make it better? We love hearing from you on [Discord](https://discord.gg/mxy7QbM).
2. Telling your friends and family about Spring.

**At Bitmark, we see Spring as the first step in a movement to restore trust in data and help fix the internet. **

Spring is for those who see how public discourse has broken down into fear mongering. For those who cannot tell what information is real. For those who are tired of being locked into Facebook. For those who wonder how billions of people can be [affected by privacy breaches](https://www.techmeme.com/search/query?q=data+leak), yet companies still gather as much personal data as they want without real responsibility. For those who feel that the manipulation of our data to swing [political elections](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/04/cambridge-analytica-data-leak-global-election-manipulation) is an unforgivable breach of trust. Spring is a new beginning.
