# Synergy app
Synergy iOS client.
---

## Building and Running
You'll need a few things before we get started. 
Make sure you have Xcode installed from the App Store. 
Then run the following command to install Xcode's command line tools, if you don't have that yet
```sh
xcode-select --install
```

Install [`Cocoapods`](https://cocoapods.org) for managing dependencies.  
Using the default Ruby install can require you to use `sudo` when installing gems.
```sh
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

After that, Cocoapods will help you install all of dependencies.
```sh
pod install
```

Alrighty! We're ready to go! Open `Synergy.xcworkspace` to start.
