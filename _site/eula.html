    <!-- # SPRING End User License Agreement -->

<p>This End User License Agreement (this “Agreement”) governs the terms and conditions of your use of the binary version of the software that accompanies this Agreement (the “Software”), and is made between you (“you” or “your”), and Bitmark Inc. (“we”, “us” or “our”).  If you are acting on behalf of an entity, such as a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity “you” refers to the entity, and you represent and warrant that you have power and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of the entity.</p>

<p>By clicking the “Accept” button for this Agreement and/or using the Software, you confirm your acceptance of, and agree to be bound by, this Agreement.  You also agree to our <a href="https://github.com/bitmark-inc/spring/blob/master/privacy-policy.md">privacy policy</a> and the terms for the data analysis project(s) in which you participate, which we will present to you at the time.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Limited Right to Use.  Subject to your compliance with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, we hereby grant to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable right to copy and use the Software on one or more devices you own, solely for your personal or internal business purposes.  You agree not to use the Software for any other purpose, provide a third party with access to, publish, distribute, transmit, or create a derivative work of, or otherwise exploit any portion of the Software or access to the Software, without our prior written permission.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ownership; Open Source.  You agree that the Software and all intellectual property rights in the Software are owned by us and/or our suppliers.  You agree not to decompile or reverse engineer any of the Software, except to the extent permitted by applicable law, and not to circumvent or interfere with any security or activation functionality if used in or with the Software.  You shall not modify or remove any copyright or other notices contained in or displayed on any the Software. We reserve all rights not specifically granted above, subject to any separate open source software licenses in the Software or components thereof. The Software contains a “Legal Notices” section which lists any open source software licenses for its components, and you may visit <a href="https://github.com/bitmark-inc/spring">https://github.com/bitmark-inc/spring</a> for a copy of the source code which we own and have made available  under an open source license.  Open source software licenses for the Software source code constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede this Agreement, the open source software licenses govern your agreement with us for the use of the Software or specific included components of the Software. You may choose to submit comments, information or feedback to us regarding the Software or services to us orally or in writing, and if you do so, you hereby grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable right to use the same in any manner for any purpose without compensation to you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Termination.  This Agreement is effective until terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of the Software in your possession or control. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from us if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon termination you must destroy all copies of the Software in your possession or control.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>THE SOFTWARE IS MADE AVAILABLE “AS IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”  WE DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE IS OR WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE.  IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, SAVINGS OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), IN EACH CASE HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<p>OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.</p>

<p>YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW IMPLIED WARRANTIES TO BE EXCLUDED OR MODIFIED OR LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED, SO NOT ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY APPLY TO YOU, AND THESE DISCLAIMERS AND WARRANTIES ARE MADE ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

<p>The disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between you and us, and you acknowledge and agree that we would not provide the Software to you without these limitations.</p>

<ol>
  <li>General.</li>
</ol>

<p>The laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflicts of law rules, govern this Agreement and your use of the Software.  The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is disclaimed.  You agree that exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or dispute arising from this Agreement shall be in the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A.</p>

<p>You may not assign or transfer this Agreement or any rights hereunder, and any attempt to the contrary is void.   Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement benefits and binds the respective successors and assigns of the parties.</p>

<p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Our failure to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>

<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements, representations, warranties, understandings or communications between the parties with respect to such subject matter.</p>

The Agreement expressly limits our liability to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<p>In the event of any third party claim that the Software  or your possession and use of that Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, we, not Apple, will be solely responsible for any investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim.</p>

<p>You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

<p>You must comply with all applicable third party terms of agreement when using the Software.</p>

<p>Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Agreement  against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.</p>
