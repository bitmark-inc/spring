## Retrospective

### Summary of events & decision
- Decided to shipped Facebook login story early to get feedback from App Store reviewer with further explanation (after several rejection).
- Apple can not log in with our provided Facebook test account so they can not proceed the review.
- Team were using various solutions including: VPN, whitehat account, to support the Apple staff to review.
- Need to answer further questions from Apple reviewer
- Infrastructure team finished data parser on Wednesday (middle of the sprint).
- Infrastructure team deployed without noticing us beforehands, blocking the sprint. Fortunately the change was small and we could handle the disruption in a short amount of time.
- We can not render the chart exactly as the design
- Deleting account is much more complicated than anticipated

### If we do the sprint again, what will we do the same?
- Decision to ship Facebook login early
- Backend and frontend cooperate well
- Anticipate problems well for some stories (new chart style)
- Send test build and get feedback early within team

### If we do the sprint again, what can we do better?
- Do not manage the data we create well in term of allowing users to control the data
- To have the PO giving early feedback on flow change
- Maybe bringing Jim or Linzy to our cycle would help with detecting problems earlier
- Be more confident in making decision on small changes
- Improve knowledge on Apple review process
- Organize design material better to save time finding correct fonts and colors

### 3 things that we will improve in the next sprint
- Maybe bringing Jim or Linzy to our cycle would help with detecting problems earlier
- Only confirm high-risk decision with Sean and make it as early as possible
- Have company demo instead to get better faster
