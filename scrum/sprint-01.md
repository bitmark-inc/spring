## Retrospective

### Summary
Sprint events & decision
- We make use of GitHub for most of the document we need to show in the app because website would be late
- We separated and public the repos, keep the original one for management and general tools and docs
- We had a lot of discussion around what system info to put in the asset metadata, Sean ends up disagree and commit to a version engineers proposed.
- We added a number of UX improvements as we think it will not affect the sprint
- Rita was on vacation without team members known
- There was a story left out in the end as we do not have enough information to do
- Lost the key to alpha version for Android
- GG Play Store version for Android got approved
- App Store version for iOS got rejected
- We still don't have a usable app, the parser is not returning correct data
- Decided to have Linzy team rewrite the parser
- Apple (and probably users) mis-understand about Facebook login

### If we do the sprint again, what will we do the same?
- Step out of comfort zone
- Responsive to change
- Apply unit test
- Working spirit - keep an open mind
- The work capacity fits
- Simplify the team to do the parser instead of putting more resource in
- Get the habit of having our work public
- Evaluate the difficulty of feedback and have appropriate reaction

### If we do the sprint again, what can we do better?
- Engineers can tell Rita why the UI is difficult to do, so Rita can make easier one in the future.
- Someone taking vacation will shout out during planning meeting
- Governance of keys, data is not good enough. We need a better policy from engineering perspective.
- Whenever we have a high-risk story, we do 2 options
- Keep pushing blockers (harder & harder) with deadline if they block the stories
- Engineers need to be more sensitive to problems might happen, make sure everybody knows
- Identify potential blocker
- Not logging actual points spending for stories
- Estimate for only one app so the current estimation left out some effort

### 3 things that we will improve in the next sprint
- Estimate for only one app so the current estimation left out some effort (2)
- Governance of keys, data is not good enough. We need a better policy from engineering perspective.
- Engineers need to be more sensitive to problems might happen, make sure everybody knows (2)
